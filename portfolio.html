	<p style="font-size:300%;"> These are my scratch projects. We created three different games. The first one features
		is about a duck trying to find its way back home. You can also collect little fruits for it during the journey.
		The second game is a bouncing ball game where you try to keep the ball up in the air with the movable floating
		block. The last game is a bear who is trying to find its way back home. enjoy!</p>

	<img scr="minesweeper.PNG" height="500"/> This is my minesweeper project. We made changes to the user interface by changing the algorithm that the mines would appear in, the color of the bombs, and the number of bombs that would appear. The purpose of the game is to avoid the bombs and make educated guesses about the bombs nearby. </p>
