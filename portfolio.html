	<p style="font-size:300%;"> These are my scratch projects. We created three different games. The first one features
		is about a duck trying to find its way back home. You can also collect little fruits for it during the journey.
		The second game is a bouncing ball game where you try to keep the ball up in the air with the movable floating
		block. The last game is a bear who is trying to find its way back home. enjoy!</p>
